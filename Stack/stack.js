//todo ---------STACK--------------------

//^ Stack 
//! Stack is linear data structure that follows LIFO
//! Last element added will be the first element to get removed

//^ Stack operations 
//! push - pushes the element to the top of the stack
//! pop - removes the element from the top of the stack
//! peek - get the value of top element without removing it
//! isEmpty - check if the stack is empty
//! size - return the number/size of the elements
//! clear - removes the elements from the stack

//^ Advantages of stacks
//! Simplicity
//! Efficiency
//! memory management

//^ Disadvantages of stacks
//! Only the top element will be accessed directly
//! Overflow and underflow

//^ stack use in program
//! Managing the function call in recursion
//! undo/redo functionality in text editors
//! Browser history navigation
//! Reversing data
//! function call stack
//! Managing temporary data

//^ stack's real time use
//! undo operatons
//! stack of plates
