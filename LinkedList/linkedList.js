//todo ----------------LINKED LIST--------------------------------

//^ Linked list is a data structure where elements are connected in a linear sequence using pointers.
//^ Linked list contains two main components
//! Data and the Node
//^ unlike arrays linked list do not store elements in the contiguous memory locations , which makes them dynamic and efficient for certain operations like insertion and deletion

//^  Types of Linked List
//* Singly Linked List
//* doubly Linked List
//* Circular linked list
//* doubly circular linked list

//* Singly linked list
//! Each node points to the next node in the sequence
//! last node's pointer is null
//! Operations like traversal are unidirectional
//* doubly linked list
//! each node contains two pointers -
//! one points to the next node and another points to the previous node
//! allows bidirectional traveral
//* circlular linked list
//! the last node points back to the head , forming a circle
//! Can be singly or doubly linked
//! No null pointers in the list
//* doubly linked list
//! similar to circular linked list but with bidirectional

//^ Advantages of Linked List
//! Dynamic size
//! Efficient Insertion/Deletion
//! Memory utilization
//! Ease of implemenation

//^ Disadvantages of Linked list
//! Memory Overhead
//! Sequential access
//! Complexity
//! Cache performance

//^ Basic Opeartions on Linked List
//! Traversal - visiting each node in list, O(n)
//! Insertion - adding the new node in the list
//! Search
//! Reversal

//^ Application of Linked List
//! Dynamic Memory allocation
//! Implementation of other data structure - stacks and queues 
//! Undo functionality
//! Navigation System
